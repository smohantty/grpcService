The project will create a grpc service interface which will have a getImage() interface that will return ImageData.
It will create a client that will use the client proxy generated by the grpc to connect to the service and call the api to get the imagedata.
It will create a service that will use the service proxy to accpet connection from multiple clients and when recive the getImage request sends the ImageData to client.
